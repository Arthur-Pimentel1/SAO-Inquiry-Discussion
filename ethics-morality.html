            <p id="ethicsDesc">The concept of 'Kill or Be Killed' in Sword Art Online raises deep ethical questions. How would morality shift if survival depended on abandoning one's principles?</p>
            <p>A “kill or be killed” virtual death game raises profound ethical and moral dilemmas. Unlike ordinary video games, where death is make-believe, a real SAO situation means every action has life-and-death consequences. Players could no longer treat killing as “just a game” or morally neutral. As Oculus founder Palmer Luckey noted when discussing raising the stakes of VR, tying a person’s real life to their avatar “instantly raise[s] the stakes to the maximum level and force[s] people to fundamentally rethink how they interact” in the virtual world​ (Gault et al.). In other words, once in-game murder equates to real murder, participants would likely behave far more cautiously and view ethical lines (like not killing innocents) much more seriously. The virtual environment stops being a consequence-free playground and instead becomes a true moral arena.</p>

            <p>Moral decision-making would likely shift under these extreme conditions. Players trapped in a lethal game face the ultimate ethical test: self-preservation versus compassion. Some individuals might revert to a survivalist mentality, akin to what philosopher Thomas Hobbes described as the “state of nature” – a lawless state where normal rules collapse and it’s “every man for himself.” In such a scenario, killing another player might be rationalized as self-defense or a necessity to survive. Indeed, psychological research on life-threatening dilemmas shows that when people are under dire threat, their moral reasoning can shift. However, not everyone would become a ruthless killer. Studies suggest that being immersed in a realistic scenario can actually heighten empathy. In one experiment, participants who experienced a moral dilemma in immersive VR were more concerned about not harming a virtual person (showing empathy for the individual in front of them) than participants who only read the scenario on paper​ (Terbeck et al.). This indicates that the presence of others (even virtual avatars) and the visceral realism of the situation could trigger players’ conscience and altruism – some may choose to help each other or refuse to kill, even at great personal risk, due to moral conviction.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, the game’s high-stakes pressure and structure could erode conventional morality for many. Psychology offers insights from situations like the Stanford Prison Experiment and fictional scenarios like <em>Squid Game</em>. Under extreme stress and group dynamics, people might do things they’d never contemplate otherwise. <em>Squid Game</em> (a deadly competition in a TV series) illustrated how anonymity and deindividuation can facilitate cruelty: masked guards in identical uniforms felt less individual responsibility and more inclined to follow orders, enabling them to kill “innocent people in cold blood” as part of the group​ (Jern). In a real SAO, players might similarly hide behind avatars or group allegiances, making it easier to justify violence. The fear of death can also trigger tunnel vision – fight-or-flight responses that bypass moral reflection. According to the Yerkes-Dodson law in psychology, a moderate level of stress can enhance performance, but extreme stress severely impairs judgment and leads to panic or “choking”​ (Jern). Translated to SAO: the ever-present terror of immediate death could drive some to panic killings or betrayal, acts they’d never consider in calm circumstances. Moral rules of engagement might deteriorate as rational strategy gives way to raw instinct.</p>
