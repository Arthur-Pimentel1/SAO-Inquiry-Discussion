            <h2 id="aboutTitle">Welcome to the SAO Digital Forum</h2>
            <p id="aboutDesc">Exploring how technology is bringing us closer to SAO and questioning how society would react in a "Kill or Be Killed" scenario.</p>
            <p>In 2022, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey created a prototype VR headset that would kill its user if they die while playing the game — a spooky nod to <em>Sword Art Online</em> (SAO), the anime show in which players are trapped in a virtual world where death is permanent. What was once science fiction is becoming increasingly real. Technologies like neural interfaces, full-body tracking, and virtual reality are evolving faster than ever before, raising a very critical question: Are we ready for what comes next?</p>
            <p>This forum asks how modern society would react if what happened in <em>Sword Art Online</em> occurred in the real world. At the center of the debate is the chilling idea of a "Kill or Be Killed" virtual reality. What happens when an internet game becomes a life-or-death situation? Would the people hold on to their morals and ethics — or forget them in order to survive?</p>
            <p>In three new perspectives, this Digital Forum investigates the crossroads of technology, ethics, and social response. The first examines how the evolution of VR, AI, and brain-computer interfaces are rapidly leading us to full-dive reality. The second discusses the ethics that would exist in a high-stakes virtual world — what is morality when life or death are on the line? The third examines society as a whole: How would people, institutions, and governments respond to the situation of thousands trapped in a digital death game?</p>
            <p>This is not science fiction fantasy — it's where we're going. Considering these questions now gives us a better sense of what's at stake as we design more immersive virtual spaces. This forum challenges you to think seriously about the future of technology and the humanity that's at risk — or, quite possibly, that we may find along the way.</p>
